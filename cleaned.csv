The newsfeed is working somewhat better. At least the most recent is back on top. Not sure why I get alerted when some people go live and not others that I look forward too. 

Another update and notification section is still not fixed!! AND why are they filled with people I‚Äôve unfollowed or people I never even read their posts?? The only time I get notifications to the pages and people I frequent are when I turn on notifications for a specific post to follow it. Otherwise it‚Äôs filled with just about everybody I‚Äôve unfollowed. WTH!!!

Notifications aren‚Äôt working right. I can only scroll down so far until it flicks and goes back to the top and every time I pull down to refresh it changes the order. I just want the order to start with the newest and go down from there. Sometimes it‚Äôs some random order I have no idea what it is.

Also annoying for all my friends to know when I like something or comment on another page. For this reason I rarely comment or react to posts that I would like to. Needs to be some privacy on that.

 Every time I watch a posted video from any source such as friend, group, or someone I‚Äôm following...when it‚Äôs finished playing, why does some random next video that I have no interest in play??

My only observation I would like to make is your designations of different regions of the state. They should be as follows:

1. NYC and Long Island: New York Metro area
2. Hudson Valley: between New York City  and Albany
3. NY Capital District
4. Binghamton and its region: southern tier 
5. Syracuse, Utica, Ithaca etc: Central NY
6. Western NY: Rochester, Buffalo area.
7. Northern NY: Adirondack Mountains, and areas between the Capital District and the Canadian border.

I hope this helps define what parts of New York we are describing in communicating our news to the general public.

So PLEASE take note, not every geographical location north of NYC is to be designated as ‚Äúupstate New York‚Äù!

New feature request: I hope to be able to view YouTube videos in a separate window like WhatsApp and be able to even view them on the YouTube app itself and not within LinkedIn app. 

New feature request: I hope to see the messaging part of the app done right. It would be much more convenient if it were in a chat format like Messages, Messenger and WhatsApp. It needs to be more responsive too. 

Feature back request: in older versions I used to tap on a connection in the people you may know section or the people who sent me connection requests to directly to the profile of that person. This has been complicated in later versions. I have to tap on the connection in the thumbnail layout to go to the profile preview layout and then tap again on the connection‚Äôs picture or the button at the bottom to go to that person‚Äôs profile. If have to zoom in on the picture, then that would be a third or fourth tap. Going back to the people you may know layout is the same exact tedious process. Also, tapping the little ‚Äòx‚Äô to close each view is a pain since you have to tap exactly in the middle of the ‚Äòx‚Äô. I‚Äôd love to tap anywhere on the ‚Äòx‚Äô to close the view.

There is NO WAY that this app is monitored at all, like it claims to be when you setup a profile. There are so many examples I can personally give. A 20th Century Fox theme song that CLEARLY depicts a swastica. Then there is the video where Spider-Man shoots I believe Deadpool with what looks like a very real pistol (Glock 19 to be exact). Or, the finger family video where all of the I believe Spider-Man characters (again) are lined up, and are shooting each other in the head blood, death whole 9. And then you have channels like ‚ÄúCandyland‚Äù. A (what sounds to be an adult male) displaying gross amounts of candy on a table then exclaiming ‚ÄúSo yummy in my tummy‚Äù. This is gross to me on so many levels. Then you have the subliminal messages in these kids videos, if you use the bar and scroll through some of the videos, you will catch an extremely brief image of something extremely creepy/ inappropriate. I do monitor what my children watch but it seems like after a week or so or after the app/device update all of the blocked videos magically appear. I uninstalled this app, it is toxic for children, I strongly suggest everyone steer clear. I have contacted you tube kids upward of 20 times but to no avail.

I use ebay for this purpose- and I usually find everything I‚Äôm looking for at great prices- but this app/website needs a MAJOR UX (user experience) overhaul. Its glitchy, and messaging/offer/‚Äúask the seller a question‚Äù features are stuck in 2003. Not smooth to use. 
For this reason, I use Mercari first, and if I can‚Äôt find what I‚Äôm looking for I‚Äôll check ebay. The messaging feature and account is more like instagram- easier to ask seller questions and make offers.
I hate bidding, limited offer, etc. features. It‚Äôs very grandma-ish imo. No one my age is patient enough to bid for things- and its not so private as just a simple offer button. 
One problem i had today that triggered me to write this review is, i am buying a snowboard thats local pick-up only, so i NEED to get into contact with the seller to meet up. I try to send her my contact information, and i get blocked from sending the message!

It also works best when controls are given meaningful labels. Most of the app seems fairly navigable, but there are many buttons--including the tab bar at the bottom--which are either unlabelled or have numbers for labels, which is more than a little bewildering. I would encourage any app developer/team of testers to attempt to navigate an app using accessibility-assistive software so as to gain an understanding of what I mean. In my attempts to use this app, I was able to get up and running, join a community,, and figure out how to navigate to posts. I came across a post by another new user asking how to find content in posts. This user was told that there are colored words that act as links in some posts. Navigating back to a post that should have a link in it, I was unable to find--much less activate--any link. This leads me to believe that these links are not created in a way recognizable to a screen reader.

I will say, however, that the website seems far more useable than the app. Why the buttons and controls there--including the links--are created and labelled properly and why there is proper navigation structure--such as headings--on the website when the app lacks these I do not know. (Incidentally, on the website, I was easily able to find and activate the link in the post which was giving me grief within the app.) I will be using the website and not the app until these things are addressed.

MULTIPLE PEOPLE YOU WILL TALK TO WILL SEND YOU THE EXACT SAME SPIEL AND NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS! WISH IS TOLERATING THESE SELLERS BECAUSE WISH MAKES MONEY OFF OF THEM BUT LEAVES BUYERS RIPPED. GIVES BUYERS SO MUCH HASSLE IN GETTING THEIR MONEY BACK, MONEY THAT WISH TOOK WITHOUT DELIVERING WHAT BUYERS PAID FOR! 
UPDATE: AFTER I POSTED THE REVIEW BELOW, DEVELOPER SENT ME A TWO LINE REPLY SAYING THAT I CAN GO TO ORDER HISTORY AND CLICK ON WHERE IS MY PACKAGE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE. ‚ÄúI HOPE THIS HELPS.‚Äù WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY HELPFUL REPLY, ISNT THIS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR THE PAST MONTH THE ONLY LINK IT GOES TO IS A MESSAGE SAYING ‚ÄúITS UNUSUAL THAT YOU HAVENT RECEIVED YOUR PACKAGE..‚Äù  AND HAVE ME KEEP WAITING FOR IT GUVING ME NO OPTION TO TALK OR EMAIL ANYONE. IF YOU ARE SOMEONE THAT IS AUTHORIZED TO REPLY AND ASSIST USERS ON HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM, SHOULDN‚ÄôT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT I WILL NOT GET TO THIS POINT WHERE IT DISPLAYS THIS MESSAGE IF I DID NOT GO TO THE LINK THAT YOU JUST TOLD ME TO GO TO? IT IS OBVIOUSLY A SARCASTIC REMARK THAT YOU SENT OUT TO ME, AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT ANYONE WOULD DO TO GET ANSWER ABOUT ANY QUESTION REGARDING AN ORDER. AND NO, NO ONE WOULD FIND YOUR SARCASTIC REPLY HELPFUL. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE GETTING PAID TOP MONEY TO JUST GIVE USERS SARCASTIC REPLIES INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HELPING US OUT. CERTAINLY A ROT IN WISH CUSTOMER SERVICE RIGHT THERE.

 I can see how everyone would love wish. I myself was excited when I first used this app. I get really good stuff for really good prices! Who doesn‚Äôt want that? Especially if you either resell them, or use them for work as giveaways, or just for personal use. Problem starts when sellers NEVER send your items, or send you something else other than what you pay for. Although Wish CLAIMS that ‚ÄúYOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY SHOPPING AT WISH‚Äù, You actually do. Because once you have a problem with an order that was NEVER sent or is not what is described or pictured, Wish will give you the runaround and you will have a hard time getting your money back! YOUR MONEY that you paid to Wish thinking you will get what they advertise! You will not find a link to contact or leave a message about a problem with your order! All the link they give you is the one that says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs unusual that you haven‚Äôt received your item‚Äù Even AFTER THEY CHANGE THE ETA OF YOUR ORDER AND YOU STILL HAVEN‚ÄôT RECEIVED, they will say to contact them after a certain amount of time, BUT YOU WILL FIND NO LINK TO CONTACT THEM ABOUT THE ORDER! I buy A LOT, in BULK usually as I use them for work as giveways for hundreds of people, and even as a frequent bulk buyer, you will still have a hard time getting help. Getting compensated for YOUR OWN MONEY that you paid in hopes you will get what you ordered.",2018-10-30 19:30:50,You can get in contact with us by going to Order History - Where's My Package?

I purchase 15-20 books per year through the audible store and I created my account prior to amazon purchasing audible in 2008 so I‚Äôd consider myself an established customer.  Up until a couple years ago, I could quickly find what I wanted, download the file and reliably listen to books.

I start my commute from the driveway, where my phone is transitioning between Wi-Fi and cellular data. That was never an issue but over the past few years the app seems to rely more and more on online content, recently adding pop-ups for amazon services and products. So I get in the car and try to start playback but the app needs 30-45 seconds to sync up before it will play. Then I hit the end of the driveway and playback stops because the app lost Wi-Fi. Another 30 seconds or so at a stop light and it‚Äôs back to working. When I leave the office I start off in a garage with no cell signal, so it‚Äôs the same process going home. Recently I‚Äôve had to log out and log back in periodically as well, the app won‚Äôt play files if it can‚Äôt sync with the server, but it can somehow push amazon prime and suggest suggest books related to ‚ÄúInternational (insert topic) Day‚Äù. 

The audio file is downloaded to my phone, I would delighted if amazon could develop an app that simply decodes it as well an iPod, or even a Zune.

906,1292,BuySellthisSpringeBay,2147483647,2018-12-31,2,Gordon of,I have been an eBay member since 2001. My family since 1998. I can‚Äôt use the app to post or edit listings anymore as it forces you to accept offers. Even if you turn off accept offers while listing in the app eBay will eventually turn it back on without you knowing until they do it. It surprises sellers and disappoints buyers when eBay does this as nobody who has it turned off is going to accept offers when eBay invariably turns on offers automatically. There is no option to prevent this from happening and a very disingenuous move. Posting and editing via website is the only way to go now. eBay needs to stop acting like they are God and more like a marketplace. Two stars instead of one because otherwise the app works well.,2019-01-07 12:57:19,"We are sorry to hear that you are having issues with the best offer function.

Why can‚Äôt the app automatically display the music I have downloaded when I am offline? Also, in offline mode the thumbnails and album covers fail to load, which is very disappointing. One of the major drawbacks of the app is the fact that it synced my likes from YouTube to the music app. Then later, when the same song appears on playlists from another source/album and you like it, you will end up with multiples of the song. The shuffle feature is simply bad as it usually plays around 30 songs back and forth... In terms of music availability the app doesn‚Äôt win Spotify.

So Netflix, answer me this, I have an iPad mini 4 - I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs accurate - and it pretty new, I‚Äôve had it for over a year. Since it is ‚Äúnew‚Äù then I have some of the latest hardware, the latest OS updates, the latest version of all the apps then. But I tried the Minecraft Story mode (in the Netflix app) a few months back on my iPad; when it started up I got that nice 10 second message saying that I needed to use a more recent, thus powerful device, so I grabbed my phone.

My phone is a note9. And this was before the s10 came out. Thus I had the latest hardware, software, apps. Everything. This phone could pretty much do any task, within reason. It‚Äôs a smartphone. But when I tried to start up the Minecraft Story mode interactive thing, I got the same 10 second video telling me to play it on a newer device such as a newer TV, smartphone, or tablet. I thought how could this be. 

Subsequently, the same thing just happened to me right now, before writing this, when I tried the new You vs. Wild interactive media with Bear grills. 

Since I have some of the latest device at my disposal I would really like to hear a response from you, Netflix, specifying why I can‚Äôt enjoy this those pieces of content. Or, you know, just fix it! Or if anyone in the reviews could write a response to, it would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I know I just asked for you guys to ‚Äújust fix it‚Äù, but if you cannot actually fix this problem, I understand - it could just be me. But some explanation would go really well with that inability to fix the problem.",,,0,compatibility,"complaint,functerr",complaint,functerr

However, those who respond to the post are generally spammers who seem to take delight in tapping the ‚ÄúIs it still available?‚Äù button. Inquiries were seldom followed up and it was a waste of time even responding. Out of the six or seven items I listed in a months time, only the two cheapest and most insignificant sold. I lowered the price, and still nothing. Apparently, if you really trying to sell anything of some value, Letgo shoppers don‚Äôt seem to be interested. I know the items were priced right because they did eventually sell for the listed price or very close.

After my posts expired, I listed them on craigslist, which generated very little interest. It says on Letgo that family and friends are generally the ones to whom items are sold and you have the option to share your posts with them. I decided that I could do that myself. I copied the URLs from craigslist and popped them into an email which was sent out to a number of friends. Within two days, literally, three of the big items were gone and the fourth item my daughter wanted. 
 
All in all, despite being a very nice looking app and with nice features, the app proved almost worthless in selling my items. I did a better job of doing it myself, although I did use links to my craigslist posts. I have a few more items left and I will be using email again but this time my own pics and my own description.

1220,1767,Duolingo,2147483647,2019-04-14,5,#jointhestickynotewars,"I‚Äôm taking Spanish lessons in school but never practice so I thought, well, why not practice with an app? So I downloaded it. I like the idea that you can learn another language so quickly (I‚Äôm also learning French on here and considering Chinese, both just for fun) and it‚Äôs cool and all, but if you want all the good stuff you have to buy Duolingo Plus. And I‚Äôm not paying anything. Why would I?

I think if you want to comment on lessons in the app you have to buy Duolingo Plus, and I don‚Äôt wanna do that, because who does?

Also if you just want a free trial, it‚Äôs not actually free. You have to set up a payment plan for after your free week of Duolingo Plus, so it‚Äôs technically not free anyway. What‚Äôs the point?

The rest of the app is fine, except for the fact that some of language is regional. For example, here in America we say ‚Äúmail‚Äù and in Britain they say ‚Äúpost.‚Äù Southerners are stereotyped to saying ‚Äúy‚Äôall,‚Äù and other people say ‚Äúyou guys,‚Äù ‚Äúyou all,‚Äù or just ‚Äúyou.‚Äù Some people say ‚Äúsoda,‚Äù some say ‚Äúpop,‚Äù and some say ‚ÄúCoke.‚Äù It‚Äôs called different words even though it‚Äôs the same thing. Likewise, Spanish differs depending on where you are, especially whether or not you‚Äôre in Spain or Latin America. I think there should be more of ‚ÄúAnother way to say it is...‚Äù

Otherwise I like the app.",,,0,pricing,"complaint,otherfunctional",complaint,otherfunctional

1232,1779,IndeedJobSearch,2147483647,2019-04-17,3,N!kname$R2Hard,"Generally, the app is great for what it is.  

Filters though should really be advanced requiring employers to be more specific about roles and allowing applicants to better target opportunities.  This is especially true for salary ranges - I understand why specifics can‚Äôt be posted but ranges at very least should be generally mandated.  

There should REALLY be an option to search for postings by date as well.  From the employer perspective, this can help prevent their being inundated with applications after time goes by.  It would also encourage employers to take down or repost jobs IF they aren‚Äôt finding the candidates they need.  As applicants, this can help target jobs as they are newer as opposed to those that are still posted for 30+ days.  (This could also be modified by a sort by date functionality, perhaps)

Postings of roles should be automatically withdrawn after a timeline pre-determined by the hiring team at time of postings.  Perhaps an option to leave roles posted at intervals of 2-weeks, 1 month, 2 months, and then 90 days.  Upon the completion of the predetermined time, a notice should be sent to the employer stating that the time has expired (or is expiring) and require an update to the posting (but still be denoted for the original date of which it was posted to be clear to the applicants). 

Specific suggestions from the applicant side of things, roles need to be more clear when they‚Äôve been previewed previously (with an option not to look at those roles again at all).  There should also be a way to check a box when a role has been applied for even if not through Indeed so that these are recognizable or even worse, applied to multiple times.  In either of these cases, there should be an automatic functionality of Indeed that job descriptions and titles are sent to the applicants registered email when they‚Äôve applied or denoted application.",2019-04-18 20:16:36,"Thank you for your feedback!

The app worked great, then I wanted to view a home. Here is where the problems began. 
I couldn‚Äôt reach the primary realtor for the property and was contacted through email about the realtor contacting me. 
I responded I was not contacted by the primary realtor, and they put me in touch with another realtor. This realtor had nothing to do with the property. I went on my own to view the property and found it was a previously listed home with new pictures. I had no need to view the property since I already viewed it 5 years ago. 

I now have a realtor contacting me everyday with houses she is getting information about from Zillow, she specifically referenced in her last email this would fit my searches. Too bad my wife changed the search parameters the night before and these houses were way out of the budget and area.

1. The buyers here are flaky. I‚Äôve had 2-3 no shows.
2. They added a cool feature called Hold for Pickup to fix the no-show issue where the buyer prepays for an item and OfferUp holds the money for a couple of days until you meet up and the sale takes place. Great! Except it doesn‚Äôt work if the buyer messages you before using the feature. Every buyer messages you to confirm the item is still available (symptom of another usability issue)
3. I emailed support to find out how these buyers can use Hold for Pickup and they replied 4 times without ever answering the original question. The last message basically suggested that my account was about to be suspended (?!?) and he ‚Äúfixed the issue‚Äù
